## About The Project

The project named "Protego" function of an email fraud detection model is to automatically identify and filter suspicious or potentially harmful emails that aim to commit fraud or other malicious activities. Here are some of the key functions of an email fraud detection model:
 - Detecting Fraud
 - Reducing Fraud Risk
 - Managing Spam Emails

## Background
Based on [stationX](https://www.stationx.net/phishing-statistics/#:~:text=Phishing%20is%20the%20single%20most,trillion%20phishing%20emails%20per%20year), estimated 3.4 billion emails are sent by cyber criminals per day. 
Around 36% of all data breaches involve phishing. This is to say, an individual has risk 
to follow or click any dangerous sources. With in this data, Protege show up to the stage to filter whether email is a fraud.

## Objective
Protego solved the problem by utilizing advanced natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to quickly and accurately analyze email. By processing and understanding the content of the email, Protego able to determine fradulent email.

## Build With
The model is built using Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. 
The model is built using the following libraries:
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/)
- [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/)

## Result
The model is able to predict whether an email is a fraud or not with 97% accuracy.
#TODO! add confusion matrix or pict here
